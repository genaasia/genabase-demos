I want to build a single-page e-commerce website for my clothing brand.
I already have a database and simple endpoints deployed that let me interact with it.
Iâ€™ve added the openapi.json for the API which is called genabase_openapi.json, as well as the schema.sql file which was used to create the database.
You can use these files to understand the database schema and learn how to read from and write to it.
The website should use this endpoint:
* **API Base URL:** `https://api.genabase.com/`
* **tenantId:** `google-oauth2|12345678901234567890`
* **dbName:** `default`
Requirements:
* Display products from the DB (including variants).
* Allow customers to add products to a cart.
* Write cart additions to the database.
* Let customers finalize their shopping and create an order, which should also be written to the database.
Notes:
* No customer sign-ups or accounts.
* No admin page.
* Only a simple, single-page website.
* The insert endpoints doesn't return the inserted data back
Technical details:
When you insert data, you can use the return_columns property in the request to get back the id or other columns created for the row.
Workflow Notes:
When an order is done, first create a user.
Insert the order to the orders table with the newly created customer id.
Also insert the items for the order to the line_items table.
Also insert the address for the order to order_addresses (both the shipping and the billing address)

## vibe_coding/

The `vibe_coding/` directory contains essential files for AI-powered web development:

- **`schema.sql`** - Defines the database schema that AI tools can use to understand your data structure
- **`genabase_openapi.json`** - Defines the API endpoints for communicating with the database. This file can also be downloaded from Genabase → Settings → Genabase API Docs → `/openapi.json`

These files provide AI tools with the necessary context to build applications that interact with your Genabase database.
